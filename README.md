<strong>I use the following technologies in my projects/My skills:</strong>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Knowledge of HTML / CSS / JS / JQUERY / SASS(SCSS) / PUG</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Adaptive and cross-browser layout</strong></li>

<p>I'm sorry that my knowledge is arranged in a chaotic order, I didn't spend time structuring it. From myself I would like to add that you can always see examples of my work, here is an example: https://sids1de.github.io/12/</p>
<p>To easily view my other works, just change the number at the end of the link (it starts with 1, the closer to the beginning, the more ancient projects you look at, you will see me as a beginner who does not understand anything)</p>
<p><sub>I start the documentation only with the 11th project, because it was with him that my "professional" activity began, the sites on which I really give my best, I use modern technologies.</sub></p>
